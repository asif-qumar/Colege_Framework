                <p>
                    HTML is the language used to create webpages. "Hypertext" refers to the hyperlinks that an HTML page
                    may contain. "Markup language" refers to the way tags are used to define the page layout and
                    elements within the page. Below is an example of HTML used to define a basic webpage with a title
                    and a single paragraph of text.

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page. An internal CSS is defined in the
                    head section of an HTML page, within a style element. The following example sets the text color of
                    ALL the h1 elements (on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the p elements to red.

                    JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a
                    part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make
                    dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

                        I completed my Btech in 2018, was placed in Wipro on-campus but didn’t join. The reason was I
                        wanted a higher package. After trying to get a job for about 8-10 months without guidance, I saw
                        a PrepBytes webinar post on my Instagram and attended that webinar. Later, in April I opted for
                        one of the placement courses - Zenith Placement Course.
